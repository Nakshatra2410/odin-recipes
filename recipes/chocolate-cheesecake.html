    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cheesecake has an ancient history, dating back to the Greeks who served it during the first Olympic Games. Over time, it evolved into countless styles, from New York baked cheesecake to Japanese souffle cheesecake. Lunchbox Cheesecake is a modern adaptation inspired by Asian “lunchbox cakes” light sponge cakes topped with cream transformed here into a cheesecake version that’s individually portioned and perfect for on-the-go indulgence.
